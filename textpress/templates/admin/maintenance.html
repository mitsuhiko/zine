    From here you can set your blog into maintenance mode and do administrative
    tasks.  It's recommend to enable maintenance mode before doing software
    upgrades, imports, exports or plugin installations.  While it's not stricly
    necessary for the latter it's good idea to test the changes before going
    live with them.  As long as maintenance mode is enabled users will see a
    message that says that the blog is in maintenance mode.
